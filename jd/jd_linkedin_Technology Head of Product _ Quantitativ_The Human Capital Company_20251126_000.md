### ABOUT THE JOB / JOB DESCRIPTION

****This role is for sponsored relocation the The Sunshine Coast, Australia****

Technology Head of Product | Quantitative Trading Data Analytics

Location: Sunshine Coast, QLD

Type: Full-time

BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)

We’re hiring the execution commander for our tech team. Your job is to install clear cadence, live visibility, and consistent accountability so quants, engineers, QA, and data deliver fast, to standard, and with clarity.

The Mission

Maximise performance across the tech function by driving ownership, velocity, and quality without adding bureaucracy.

What You’ll Own (Outcomes, Not Activity)

Cadence: Run short, sharp stand ups, sprint planning, and retros that end with clear owners, deadlines, and next steps.

Visibility: Keep boards and dashboards accurate in real time.

Standards: Define and uphold concise, consistent standards across all technical outputs.

Reporting: Deliver crisp, structured updates on progress, blockers, and velocity to leadership.

Escalation: Surface issues early with options and solutions ready.

Culture: Normalise urgency and ownership; we attack targets, we don’t narrate activity.

Problems You’ll Solve

• Diffused ownership and shared tasks that dilute performance

• Meetings that report activity instead of driving decisions

• Inconsistent standards and variable quality

• Delivery data that lags reality

• Blockers that linger and deadlines that slip without accountability

What “Good” Looks Like in 90 Days

• A predictable delivery rhythm across all workstreams including quants, engineering, QA, and data

• Real time delivery data leaders trust

• Clear standards adopted without slowing teams

• Faster issue resolution and fewer rolled over tasks

• Team language shifts from “I’m working on” to “I delivered” or “I’m blocked by X”

Must Haves (Non Negotiables)

• Detail obsessed, structured, and consistent

• High EQ and credible across quants, engineers, QA, and data

• Holds the line on ownership and deadlines while keeping culture positive

• Loyal, coachable, and outcome focused

• Ships fast, iterates, improves; progress over perfection

Nice to Haves

• Experience in data heavy or quantitative product environments

• Familiarity with modern delivery patterns such as Kanban or Scrum hybrids, trunk based development, and CI/CD

This Role Isn’t for You If

• You add process layers or reporting for their own sake

• You want strategy or vision setting more than executional discipline

• You avoid accountability conversations

Why Join

• High ownership, visible impact, and a mandate to make delivery work

• Tight knit team on the Sunshine Coast building things that ship

• Competitive package, tools that don’t fight you, and leadership that backs outcomes

How to Apply

Send your CV and a short note with two examples where you improved delivery velocity or quality (include metrics) via LinkedIn Easy Apply.

Optional: attach a one page runbook showing how you’d stand up cadence, visibility, and standards in your first 30 days.
